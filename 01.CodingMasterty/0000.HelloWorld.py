# Target - Solve 100 Variety of Coding Problems

# WIBBIFIDGAJEACT ? :
# ---> Absolutely NOT!! :P

# If you have a a well defined Goal. It is achievable!!!

# Rules

# Only self coded answers will count here
# A problem is said to be complete if you do it entirely from scratch. You r not allowed to copy parts, even if same from another file
# Copied codes doesnt count, unless you really work it out on your own
# Please store references about where you fround those problems from
# If you use separate concepts to solve same problems, feel free to count them separately - Ie same problem using Recursion,Dynamic Programming
# Get stuck for long time?:D. Leave it and come back later! Thats perefectly Natural


# Count --> 28 ie 28% is done!!


# DFS
# BFS
# Matching Parenthesis
# Making use of HashTables , for keeping track of already visited
# How to manipulate multiple Variables/Pointers at once
# Find Longest Palindromic Substring in a string
