# If you have a a well defined Goal. It is achievable!!!

# Rules

# Only self coded answers will count here
# A problem is said to be complete if you do it entirely from scratch. You r not allowed to copy parts, even if same from another file
# Copied codes doesnt count, unless you really work it out on your own
# Please store references about where you fround those problems from
# If you use separate concepts to solve same problems, feel free to count them separately - Ie same problem using Recursion,Dynamic Programming
# Get stuck for long time?:D. Leave it and come back later! Thats perefectly Natural


# Count --> 40 ie 40% is done!!
