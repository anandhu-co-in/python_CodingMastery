# Given an array arr[] of strings, the task is to print the strings from the array which are not prefix of any other string from the same array.
#
# Examples:
#
# Input: arr[] = {“apple”, “app”, “there”, “the”, “like”}
# Output:
# apple
# like
# there
# Here “app” is a prefix of “apple”
# Hence, it is not printed and
# “the” is a prefix of “there”
#
# Input: arr[] = {“a”, “aa”, “aaa”, “aaaa”}
# Output:
# aaaa
