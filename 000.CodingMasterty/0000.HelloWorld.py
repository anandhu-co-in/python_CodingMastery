# Target - Solve 1000 Variety of Coding Problems


#FOR WHAT?

#---> To make myself happy

#Will i be disappointed if i didnt get any job opertunity even though i completed this ? :
#---> Absolutely NOT!! :P

#Never get Overwhelmed. You have a a well defined Goal. It is achievable!!!


#Rules

#Only self coded answers will count here
#A problem is said to be complete if you do it entirely from scratch. You r not allowed to copy parts, even if same from another file
#Copied codes doesnt count, unless you really work it out on your own
#Please store references about where you fround those problems from
#If you use separate concepts to solve same problems, feel free to count them separately - Ie same problem using Recursion,Dynamic Programming
#Get stuck for long time?:D. Leave it and come back later! Thats perefectly Natural


# Count --> 14 1% is done!!
